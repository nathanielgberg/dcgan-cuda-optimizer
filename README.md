## Overview

DCGANs have become a popular architecture for generating high-quality images using convolutional layers in both the generator and discriminator networks. This project explores how CUDA-based GPU acceleration can be integrated to optimize training by:
- Reducing training time
- Enhancing resource utilization
- Maintaining (or improving) output quality

## Objectives

- **Performance Optimization:** Accelerate critical operations (e.g., convolutions and matrix multiplications) using CUDA.
- **Scalability:** Evaluate the impact of GPU optimizations on training large-scale networks.
- **Quality Evaluation:** Ensure that accelerated training maintains or improves the quality of generated images.

## Methodology

1. **Baseline DCGAN Implementation:**  
   A standard DCGAN model was implemented using deep learning frameworks.

2. **CUDA Integration:**  
   The implementation was modified to run on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA, enabling parallel processing of key operations.

3. **Performance Benchmarking:**  
   Training times and resource utilization were measured for both the CPU-only and CUDA-optimized versions.

4. **Analysis:**  
   Output images and training metrics (e.g., loss curves, training speed) were compared to assess the benefits of GPU optimization.
   
## Results and Discussion

- **Training Speed:**  
  The CUDA-optimized version reduced the training time significantly compared to the CPU-only implementation.
  
- **Resource Utilization:**  
  GPU profiling showed increased utilization of CUDA cores and improved throughput for convolution and matrix operations.

- **Output Quality:**  
  The generated images maintained high visual quality, demonstrating that the optimizations did not degrade performance.

## Future Work

Future enhancements may include:
- Integrating advanced CUDA libraries and further tuning hyperparameters.
- Extending the implementation to support larger network architectures and datasets.
- Exploring additional GPU optimization techniques such as Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP).
